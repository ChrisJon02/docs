# Obtain Private Key

In the [TMKMS Setup](tmkms-setup.md) section of this guide we will import the Validators private key.

If you have a pre-existing Akash Validator the private key from this instance may be used.

If this is a new Akash Validator - create an Akash validator instance for the purpose of private key generation, capture the private key, and then shut down the validator.
