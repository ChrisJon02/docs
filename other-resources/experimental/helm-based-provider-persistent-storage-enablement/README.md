# Helm Based Provider Persistent Storage Enablement



## **Overview**

At Akash we use the Kubernetes Rook Operator coupled with the Ceph distributed file system to provision Provider persistent storage.

Refer to the [ Akash Provider](../akash-cloud-provider-build-with-helm-charts/) guide if your provider has not yet been built.

We encourage becoming familiar with Rook and Ceph prior to configuring Akash persistent storage via this [guide](https://rook.github.io/docs/rook/v1.8/).  The current persistent storage use is based on Rook version 1.8.

Please take into consideration the following Akash recommendations:

* Persistent storage should only be enabled on Kubernetes nodes that are NOT serving as control-plane/master nodes.
* Ceph will only deploy itâ€™s distributed file system on unformatted volumes  A node must have unformatted volumes mounted to serve persistent storage capabilities.
