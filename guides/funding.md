# Fund your Account

This guide will walk you through funding an account on an Akash network. Funding your network account is, of course, crucial to using the network - all messages charge a transaction fee, and if you are deploying applications then the leases for that deployment are paid out of your account. There are a number of different ways to fund your account.

## Buy $AKT

Tokens may currently be purchased on exchanges listed [here](https://akash.network/token). From there you can send tokens to your Akash account address.

## Apply for Community Awards 

Developers can apply for awards from the  Community Awards program. Please read the article [**Introducing the Akash Community Awards**](https://forum.akash.network/t/introducing-the-community-awards-program/) and follow the steps below:

1. [ ] [Create a free account with GitHub](https://forum.akash.network/login). We use a Discourse community to provide a transparent platform for requesting and granting awards to developers.
