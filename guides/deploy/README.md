## Akashlytics Deploy Overview

The Akashlytics Deploy Tool is a desktop application which simplifies the deployment process on the Akash Network.  Post deployment the tool provides a dashboard to view the status and details of workloads.  The dashboard also has the ability to perform administrative tasks including closing the deployment, updating the deployment, redeploying, and increasing the funding available to the deployment.
