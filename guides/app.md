### **Akashlytics Deploy Initial Configuration - All Operating Systems**

In the section that follows detailed steps are provided pertaining to the initial configuration of Akashlytics Deploy.  The initial steps in configuration to ready the application for Akash deployment creations are brief and include the following:

* Import an Existing Wallet funded with sufficient AKT to allow workload deployments
* Validation of funded Akashlytics Deploy instance and valid certificate to allow deployments

#### **STEP1 - Import Existing Wallet**

* An existing wallet import is necessary to fund Akashlytics Deploy deployments to the Akash network
* The import may be conducted via pre-existing wallet’s mnemonic as depicted below
* Remaining configuration attributes required within this step:
  * Choose a name for this wallet
    * May be any useful, descript name of the wallet instance as it appears in Akashlytics Deploy
    * A password to protect access to the wallet’s funds within Akashlytics Deploy.  Password entry will be necessary whenever the Akashlytics Deploy application is closed and then re-launched.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dCDPg7h0GCboGGryK5QgzsTk8ngnsoRimfS6MJ9cx7vPWx1G40FSeGu2rAj8w-YiLsgSyD9OTDlNZTg1ZEJjZLcNMjAbP2vajnDAE\_RETz6XLF1JDnGW64DQg2ujaVwNXIrEkDVU=s0)

#### **STEP2 - Validation of Wallet Funding and Certificate**

* Following successful import of an existing wallet the Akashlytics Deploy application display as depicted below
* Note regarding wallet funding:
  * The funds available in the pre-existing wallet instance should now be available to Akashlytics and displayed in the upper left corner of the application (52.943 AKT in the provided example)
  * Should a need arise to delete the wallet - for the purpose of introducing a new wallet - the deletion may be conducted via the triple dot icon to the right of the wallet instance on this screen.
* Note regarding Certificate:
  * Most likely the Certificate section - upper right hand corner as depicted below - will report no valid certificate found on initial application access.
  * A new certificate may be generated by selecting the triple dot icon to the right of the Certificate status representation.

## **Create a Deployment**

In this section a WordPress application will be deployed onto the Akash network using Akashlytics Deploy.  The example will provide illustration of the ease in deployment utilizing the Akashlytics Deploy application as contrasted to the somewhat burdensome processes utilizing CLI instances necessary prior.  While the example is rather simple in using a predefined (Stack Definition Language) SDL file - identical processes may be followed for complex deployments using highly customized manifest for subsequent needs.

#### **STEP1 -  Create the Deployment Instance**

* From the Dashboard pane select the “CREATE DEPLOYMENT” button as depicted below
* Note - the CREATE DEPLOYMENT option from the Dashboard pane would only be present when there are no pre-existing, active deployments.  Future deployment creation should be conducted within the Deployments pane where an identical “CREATE DEPLOYMENTS” button and option are available.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cITOXBIBZWEZe7vFJfQYpzHEO6ZS8K4FPCI5mpRDAYFzdZ9FIV7dJtvUY8THbd7ll3UqpKjEd6ZdWb0EdUvUAdNXzea40JpXe9CoBR22NpfOge2AwtTuwmnJyVpdiHK2U2XMVNf8=s0)

#### **STEP2 -  Checking Deployment Pre-Reqs**

* Following the provoke of a deployment creation - the initial, subsequent pane in the creation process validates the requirements to proceed as depicted in the capture below.
* Deployment requirements and associated validations include:
  * 5AKT are available in wallet/escrow account
  * Valid certificate (on chain and matching cert locally)
* Select the “CONTINUE” button

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/19ivZkQtByvta\_6a8lV8nuPnxtn8PDcv6a65pSLansGB1JOsdVCcNWPk8pBLcRAzuZ\_Qdc3r9WaahdPj9vVCnXea5dBS-p3GekVPBAbo0uodNUb5tsEBSopdv4XjPhKXVPHV0Jkv=s0)

#### **STEP3 -  Choose Template**

* Within this example and to provide a simple starting point in Akashlytics Deploy usage - the example WordPress template and associated SDL are utilized as depicted below
* Akashlytics Deploy provides several sample templates for initial exposure and experimentation including Games (Supermario, Minecraft, etc) and General (Wordpress, Hello-World, etc)
* Note that to deploy a custom application the Empty template may be selected and then custom SDL would be specified in subsequent steps that follow
* Press “CONTINUE” with the Wordpress template selected

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/70YVBS9Q\_lB5j7mHDnwcC8iNFJT6ueqarfPG9\_BnDcvmcBwgHDG24RyiTJDvbbvq-HngUgMnC05-Cex6QeiM-VbBxBIs78259J\_NUgexDIrkOfNBsfQ203WqwbGR1FC0b\_9MBx99=s0)

#### **STEP4 -  Create Deployment**

* Constitutes the final configuration step in the deployment creation process
* Within this section the sample SDL may be edited for minor adjustments or could be completely replaced for custom application deployment
* Note the hyperlink provided for SDL referencing needs for those interested in custom deployments
* In the current example only a minor edit to the SDL will be conducted and is necessary.  The domain name in the SDL’s “expose” stanza must be updated.
* In production use the domain name should be updated to an actual resolvable name.  But for experimentation purposes the domain name may be updated to a factius convention.
* In the depictions below the SDL pre and post domain name manipulation are both provided for clarity.
* Following the domain name adjustment - enter a name for your deployment in the bottom pane and as instructed and then press “CREATE DEPLOYMENT” as depicted in the second capture below.

**Pre-Domain Name Edit Screen**
