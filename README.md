# Akash Overview

Welcome to the support documentation and user guides for [Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash), the decentralized cloud platform. Akash -- "open space, sky" in ancient Sanskrit -- is the world’s first distributed peer-to-peer open cloud computing marketplace; our aim is to materialize the vision of an open cloud that’s as boundless and free as the sky.

For details about what [Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash) can do and what makes it tick, see [Features and Design](decentralized-cloud/design.md).
